# Introduction 
Café Harmony is a fast-rising virtual café brand celebrated for its wide variety of beverages, snacks, and light meals. In just a year, it has grown remarkably and now faces the exciting challenge of expanding its operations to keep up with increasing customer demand. With multiple outlets across the city, each branch reflects unique performance trends and caters to the distinct preferences of its local community.

#  Business Problem
Café Harmony is growing at a remarkable pace and is now focused on boosting operational efficiency while elevating customer satisfaction. To move forward, the brand needs to pinpoint its best-selling menu items across branches, identify the customer groups driving the most revenue, streamline inventory management to avoid shortages or excess stock, and assess performance at both the branch and employee levels.

# Methodology
MS Excel was used to carry out the analysis, I gathered the café’s datasets, which were spread across five different sheets, namely:

Sales Data
Customer Data
Employee Data
Feedback Data
Stock Data

I performed data wrangling and cleaning on the datasets by removing duplicates and empty records across all sheets. I went ahead to create a new column for Age Group in the Sales Data and restructured the information by merging it with the Customer Data using the unique Customer ID. Afterward, I generated Pivot Tables for in-depth analysis and finally developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the data and reveal key insights.
