# Introduction 
Café Harmony is a fast-rising virtual café brand celebrated for its wide variety of beverages, snacks, and light meals. In just a year, it has grown remarkably and now faces the exciting challenge of expanding its operations to keep up with increasing customer demand. With multiple outlets across the city, each branch reflects unique performance trends and caters to the distinct preferences of its local community.

#  Business Problem
Café Harmony is growing at a remarkable pace and is now focused on boosting operational efficiency while elevating customer satisfaction. To move forward, the brand needs to pinpoint its best-selling menu items across branches, identify the customer groups driving the most revenue, streamline inventory management to avoid shortages or excess stock, and assess performance at both the branch and employee levels.

# Methodology
MS Excel was used to carry out the analysis, I gathered the café’s datasets, which were spread across five different sheets, namely:

Sales Data
Customer Data
Employee Data
Feedback Data
Stock Data

I performed data wrangling and cleaning on the datasets by removing duplicates and empty records across all sheets. I went ahead to create a new column for Age Group in the Sales Data and restructured the information by merging it with the Customer Data using the unique Customer ID. Afterward, I generated Pivot Tables for in-depth analysis and finally developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the data and reveal key insights.

 The female customers contributed 54% of total sales.
 Male customers accounted for the remaining 46%. 
The age of customers ranged from 18 to 65 years and was classified into five groups: Young Adult, Adult, Elder, Aged and Old Aged 

Young Adult category had the highest revenue contribution at 24.6%, followed closely by the Aged at 23%, followed by Young Adult with the contribution of 22%. The Old Aged contributed the least at only 8.7% across all locations.

# Menu Performace

From the Product Revenue chart across all locations, Muffins emerged as the top-selling item, generating the highest revenue of $2,401 and standing out as the overall customer favorite. By applying the Sales Location slicer on the dashboard, I found that Muffins performed best at the Airport ($626) and Uptown ($729). In contrast, Iced Tea led in revenue at the Suburb ($659) and Downtown ($645). Cappuccino consistently ranked as the second-best seller across most locations, except in the Suburb, where it came in third.

# Stock Management

From the Stock Performance chart, Milk ranks as the most understocked item, followed by Iced Tea Bags, Croissant Dough, Muffin Mix, and Tea Bags. These items are primarily raw materials for the café’s top-selling products, which explains why they deplete faster than others. To strengthen stock management, the café can: (1) leverage sales data to forecast usage and automate replenishment before critical ingredients run out, and (2) maintain buffer stock for high-demand products such as Muffins, Iced Tea, and Cappuccino..

# Customer Feedback
<img width="262" height="192" alt="eb1d5c97a38c25c32a3ac93cdbb5e1af_Screenshot%202025-08-27%20095632_raw=true" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e48f37e-ef84-4c7a-bd61-076f577f87d4" />

According to the Customer Ratings chart, most customers awarded 4 stars (217) and 3 stars (206), while 199 customers gave a full 5-star rating. Since 1 represents negative feedback and 5 indicates the highest satisfaction, this shows that overall customer satisfaction is moderate, but there is significant room to convert 3- and 4-star experiences into 5-star ones. Notably, 190 and 188 customers rated their experiences 1 and 2 stars, highlighting areas that require urgent attention.

# Recommendations:

Conduct deeper analysis of feedback from customers who rated 1–3 stars to identify recurring issues such as slow service or product quality concerns.
Introduce loyalty programs and targeted follow-up surveys to re-engage dissatisfied customers and encourage repeat visits.

Customer Sentiment analysis further reveals that a larger proportion of customers reported negative experiences (344) compared to neutral (340) and positive (316). This aligns closely with the ratings trend. By addressing the issues uncovered in lower ratings and implementing the suggested improvements, customer sentiment is likely to shift positively over time.

# Trends
  Muffins and Iced Tea emerged as the clear favorites, topping sales across all four locations. Cappuccino also held its ground, consistently ranking among the top three 
  most in-demand products.
  When it comes to revenue, female customers outspent males across every location, with the youth segment (ages 18–39) driving the highest share of earnings.
  On the inventory side, Juice Concentrate was the only item maintained at the right stock levels—everything else was either overstocked or understocked.
  Employee performance showed a perfect split: half exceeded expectations, while the other half fell short. Uptown stood out as the weakest branch, with 55% of its staff 
  performing below average.
  Customer feedback painted a mixed picture. While the overall rating averaged a 3, negative sentiments outweighed both neutral and positive ones, signaling room for 
  improvement in customer experience.

# Business Recommendations
# Menu Performance
Café Harmony should reassess its underperforming menu items—particularly Sandwiches and Lattes, which consistently ranked among the least preferred. These products may be contributing to lower customer satisfaction and negative sentiment scores.

# Stock Management
A more robust inventory strategy is essential. Implementing a buffer stock system will help ensure that high-demand ingredients are always available. Understocking not only prevents the business from meeting customer demand but also leads to revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction from unfulfilled orders. At the same time, data-driven monitoring should be applied to avoid overstocking, which unnecessarily ties up capital in idle resources.

# Customer Loyalty
Introducing loyalty programs or incentives for repeat customers can strengthen retention and enhance customer lifetime value (CLV). Rewarding returning patrons fosters stronger relationships and builds long-term revenue.

# Employee Development
Immediate investment in employee welfare and training is vital. Addressing knowledge gaps in customer service, enhancing staff motivation, and providing meaningful benefits and incentives will boost productivity. In turn, improved employee performance translates directly into higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue.
